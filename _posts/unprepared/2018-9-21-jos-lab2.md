##Part3:Kernel Address Space
32位线性地址中分为高地址和低地址两部分其分界线是：ULIM；用户环境将会控制低地址部分，内核则拥有高地址部分的完全控制权。系统在高地址为内核保留了256MB的存储空间.
###Permissions and Fault Isolation(权限和故障隔离)
The user environment will have no permission to any of the memory above ULIM, while the kernel will be able to read and write this memory. For the address range [UTOP,ULIM), both the kernel and the user environment have the same permission: they can read but not write this address range. This range of address is used to expose certain kernel data structures read-only to the user environment. Lastly, the address space below UTOP is for the user environment to use; the user environment will set permissions for accessing this memory.
